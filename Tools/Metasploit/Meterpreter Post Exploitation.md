## Meterpreter
- Payload operates via DDL injection and is executed in the memory making it difficult to detect
- Allows us to load custom scripts and plugins dynamically
- MSF provides us with various types of meterpreter payloads that can be used based on the target env. and the OS architecture

### Options
- `sessions -C <command> -i <session no>`: run command without interacting with it
- `session -n <name> -i <session no>`: rename session

### Commands
- `download`
- `upload`
- `checksum md5`
- `getenv <variable_name>`
- `search -d /<path> -f *<name>*`
- `search -f <name>`
- `shell`
- `ps`
- `migrate <PID>`
- `migrate -N <process_name>`

### Upgrading command shell to meterpreter
- Get a normal shell
- Background it
- use `post`
