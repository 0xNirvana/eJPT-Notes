- Users are stored in `/etc/passwd` file, accessible to all the users usually
- Password hashes are stored in `/etc/shadow` file, accessible only to root
- Hashing mechanism used
|Values | Algorithm|
| --- | --- |
| $1| MD5|
| $2| Blowfish|
|$5 | SHA-256|
|$6| SHA-512|

## Dumping hashes using #tools/multi/msfconsole 
- Get a shell as a user who has access to both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` file
- Run `pst/linux/gather/hashdump` which will create an unshadowed file
- Based on the hash value select the correct format
	```
	john --format=sha512crypt <file> --wordlist=<list>
	hashcat -a3 -m 1800 <file> <wordlist>
	```
